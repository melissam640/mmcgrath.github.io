        <p className="about-me">
            With four years in construction project management, I've refined 
              my problem-solving, teamwork, and project execution abilities. 
              Transitioning from construction, I pursued programming for its 
              logical problem-solving appeal, completing a rigorous bootcamp at 
              Hackbright. I'm eager to apply my engineering background and 
              technical expertise to innovate in software development, 
              contributing to impactful projects and advancing in the field.
